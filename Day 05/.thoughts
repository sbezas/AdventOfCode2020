Looks like I'll be creating a sort algorithm similar to what's introduced in the early classes of CS50. Not sure how it'll look in practice or if my implementation will be a legitimate algorithm or not, will be very interesting to see how it plays out
Just finished and very happy with my results! Took some advice and converted most of my if statements into functions. Was also happy with the binary search function I developed. Good day today.

I felt that I was starting this one off with some elegance, but quickly fell apart and got really to the sloppy and dirty code just to get it to work, which it did in the end. Very interested to see how I could have made this better, which I am certain that I could. It grew late and I simply wanted to get to the correct answer.

Opportunites:
	Was there a way to cycle through the list of fields for Part 1 instead of explicitly listing each one? I created the array [fields], I could have just counted the number of valid records and kept a tally, but couldn't sort out how I could assign the value as I was looping through the list of passports. I wanted to be able to create a variable using the list element as the prefix and then a static Val or Loc for the suffix, but not sure how to do that
	For the multiple OR values, have it reference a list rather than typing them all out. I could have done another loop, but was weary of yet another nested loop.
